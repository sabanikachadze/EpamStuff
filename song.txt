Forever, eternal cripples of speech
Who hasn't heard my brother
The care of the neighborhood and the beauty of adversity
On my heels, I'll write verses in the sunsets
Verses not for everyone, for some, the wind
Keep an eye on the sails, the dead ends are trimmed
We trampled the planet with our feet, we walked through the valleys, we walked through the streets, we tempered time
I'm out of sight, out of the pit
Let's plant a tree
I have nothing to live for if you're not around, no matter what

Someday I'll get myself together, it's infuriating
This sediment of misunderstandings between me and myself
And in my sea, the raft is sinking
That is wildly distorted
I'm Buster Keaton
And I want to laugh less and less
I'll count my pluses without counting my fingers
We penetrate the depths of the mind
Open up to the sound
Stonehenge on beats
Appreciate, bro
