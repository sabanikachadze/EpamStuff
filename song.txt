Forever, eternal cripples of speech
Who hasn't heard my brother
The care of the neighborhood and the beauty of adversity
On my heels, I'll write verses in the sunsets
Verses not for everyone, for some, the wind
Keep an eye on the sails, the dead ends are trimmed
We trampled the planet with our feet, we walked through the valleys, we walked through the streets, we tempered time
I'm out of sight, out of the pit
Let's plant a tree
I have nothing to live for if you're not around, no matter what

Someday I'll get myself together, it's infuriating
This sediment of misunderstandings between me and myself
And in my sea, the raft is sinking
That is wildly distorted
I'm Buster Keaton
And I want to laugh less and less
I'll count my pluses without counting my fingers
We penetrate the depths of the mind
Open up to the sound
Stonehenge on beats
Appreciate, bro

It's definitely a manga, it's bloody Babylon.
The streets were burning and freedom was on its heels.
Then a happy bustle instantly covered me.
My head was like a schoolboy's.
I'll burst in so hard I'll be sure.

This smoke from the windows is a luxury message.
Among my peers, it's wild.
Brother, I haven't cooled down.
Manga is woven.
I would have floated like a whirlpool of reality.
I would have been made of bast.
But I would have howled like a thread.
She talked nonsense, saying, "Now, let's have a ball."
Dan there.
They predicted an unknown napalm in mantras.
I scored a point, played, but I was stingy with the idea.
My thoughts are on paper.
What you wanted so much.
What drives these ideas.
You can't buy it for money.
Here, in the old way, they can get into the scoreboard for a thrill.
Old friends, the Ninja Turtles. The shells are strong, but doped up
Cilantro rules
In her life, it's a stage to do something fun
Chopped some wood, let's burn the coals
Polife
For our actions
We alone are responsible
Censorship is hiding bongs, brother, take us
