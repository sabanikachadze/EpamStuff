Forever, eternal cripples of speech
Who hasn't heard my brother
The care of the neighborhood and the beauty of adversity
On my heels, I'll write verses in the sunsets
Verses not for everyone, for some, the wind
Keep an eye on the sails, the dead ends are trimmed
We trampled the planet with our feet, we walked through the valleys, we walked through the streets, we tempered time
I'm out of sight, out of the pit
Let's plant a tree
I have nothing to live for if you're not around, no matter what
